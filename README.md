# Sarcasm Detector
 Spotting the Snark: Developing an NLP Model for Sarcasm Detection
 
 # About the project:
The problem statement for the sarcasm detection NLP project using logistic regression for headlines is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can automatically detect whether a given headline is sarcastic or not. With the vast amount of textual data available online, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to accurately distinguish between sarcastic and non-sarcastic content. This can be useful in various applications such as social media monitoring, online reputation management, and sentiment analysis. The main goal of this project is to provide a solution that can efficiently and effectively identify sarcastic headlines, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of NLP applications.
